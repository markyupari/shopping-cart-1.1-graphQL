## Shopping Cart basic example

This page is an example of how to make a Shopping Cart with some basic funcionalities:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stock control:</strong> When a item is added to Cart, stock of that item decreases and viceversa. If stock for a item reaches 0 then it no longer adds items of that type to the cart</li>
  <li><strong>CheckOut:</strong> When a item is added or removed from Cart, checkout amount is updated.</li>
  <li><strong>Restock:</strong> Through a button, you can restock items from a local server set up using Strapi</li>
  <li><strong>Images:</strong> Every item has a random image that changes when the page is rendered</li>
</ul>
React hooks like useState, useEffect, useReducer are used to control de variables.  
React-bootstrap is used to used to style the components.
